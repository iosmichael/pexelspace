In Header:

<script src="./Assets/JS/dropzone.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="Assets/CSS/dropzone.css">


Wherever you want dropzone:

<form action="upload.php" class="dropzone">
	<div class="dz-message">
		<img class="dz-img" src="Assets/Images/upload.png">
		<br>
		<p class="dz-drop-msg">Drop File Here to Submit</p>
		<br>
		<p class="dz-click-here">Or Click Here</p>
	</div>
</form>


To do something after a file uploads, put this js in a file:
Dropzone.forElement(QuerySelector).on("success", function(a) { 
	 //Whatever Happens
});
***Replace QuerySelector the parameter with a query selector, 
   so for an id "johnny", you would replace it with "#johnny"***


Custom Styling has been done in the bottom of global.css,
	Feel free to restyle however you would like or add/remove elements inside 
	the body of the dropzone. It is important that the <div class="dz-message"> stays though.
	So don't delete that element.
